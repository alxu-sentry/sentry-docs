Dashboards provide a single view of your application's health, including the ability to navigate issues and performance across multiple projects.

Dashboards are made up of one or more widgets. Each of these widgets is a visualization of one or more [Discover queries](/product/discover-queries/).

Dashboards are shared across users of your organization. When visiting Dashboards for the first time, your organization is provided a set of pre-built widgets. You may edit them to suit your organization's needs.
