Dashboards help you gain detailed perspectives of your application's health by providing visibility to your errors and transactions across multiple projects in a single view.

Dashboards are comprised of one or more dashboard widgets. Each widget is a visualization of one or more [Discover queries](/product/discover-queries/).
